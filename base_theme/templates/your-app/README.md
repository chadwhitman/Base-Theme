###### If you are creating a custom base theme, create a directory for your app and extend off the base.html template, like so:

<pre><code>templates/
     app1/ #same name as your app
           base.html # Inherits from your base.html
           list.html
     app2/ #same name as your app
           base.html # Inherits from your base.html 
</code></pre>
